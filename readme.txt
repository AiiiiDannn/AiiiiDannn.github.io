--Readme document for Aiden Hai--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

This assignment took approximately 2 days to complete, including research, design, coding, and debugging.
I have some background in webpage designing, so it took less time than others.




4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

https://benscott.dev/#hero
https://fayekollig.com/
https://www.chintristan.io/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpIel9cv4Jk
https://validator.w3.org/ -> for validation
https://fonts.google.com/ -> for font
https://icons8.com/ -> download icon needed



5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I talked to Sugeily Valentina Angulo-Limon about the simple organization of each page and the content. She also reminded me that even though there is no late deduction for A1, late submission affects the participation grades. No code was shared, and all work submitted is my own.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

Make sure to keep the assets folder intact, as it contains icons and images used throughout the site. Just download everything and leave it there.
The website is fully responsive; however, for optimal viewing, it is recommended to use desktop or laptop browser, and full screen.
